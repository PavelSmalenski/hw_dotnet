Flags attribute is used to enable bit-based operations on Enum value.
This can be used to enable storing several values ('Flags') inside one variable
One of practical usages of such approach is for storing user accesses inside one value (int which bytes will represent whether user "Have/Don't have" access to a particular part of an application)
